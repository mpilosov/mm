Meet Mika McKinnon:  Hi! I\u0026#39;m a disaster researcher (landslides in space with @ESPRESSO_SSERVI!), TV \u0026amp; movie science consultant, field geophysicist, \u0026amp; freelance science communicator. I\u0026#39;m usually somewhere along the West Coast of North America.\nEasiest way to contact me is https://t.co/7YGZMmSGrN pic.twitter.com/UyWIwa0P2G\n\u0026mdash; Mika McKinnon (@mikamckinnon) March 10, 2018  \nI came across her Twitter yesterday while I was sheltering-in-place during the \u0026ldquo;bomb cyclone\u0026rdquo; hitting Denver, and this tweet jumped out at me immediately (I ‚ù§Ô∏è2Ô∏è‚É£üëÄ math on social media):\n Stargate, some Star Trek: Discovery, a bit of Madam Secretary, a whole lot of No Tomorrow, some kids shows... My math is all over your tv shows ;)\n\u0026mdash; Mika McKinnon (@mikamckinnon) March 13, 2019  \nNaturally, I jumped into the conversation (thanks, Twitter!) and let my curiosity get the best of me:\n Sure; ping via https://t.co/tExPpQugTr\nTop tip: Check out @SciEntExchange For me? Right place, right time for the start; maintaining my network everything afterwards\n\u0026mdash; Mika McKinnon (@mikamckinnon) March 13, 2019  \nWe arranged a time to speak this morning and I was delighted to hear about her journey through geophysics to consulting on the scientific integrity in modern storytelling.\n I have selected some highlights from the interview to address how she got involved with this facet of science communication, but I am saving some of her stories for future blog posts (complete with pictures and sources to more scientific information!). \nYou\u0026rsquo;ve got an impressive history on some big shows. How did you get involved in the film and television industry?\n I was in grad school doing disaster work. I actually started with volcanos on Mars and then ended up doing landslides on Earth! I was in Vancouver, which is nicknamed Hollywood North because we have so much SciFi filmed there \u0026hellip; all these alien planets look like the Pacific Northwest.\nOne day we got a call for the physics department saying \u0026ldquo;we need a string theorist!\u0026rdquo; I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a string theorist but my buddy Steve was\u0026hellip; he literally put his research notes up on the sets of Stargate; he published string theory in Stargate three years before his dissertation. It was really fun, and I quickly realized that they didn\u0026rsquo;t actually need a \u0026ldquo;string theorist;\u0026rdquo; that was just the fanciest scientist they could think of.\nWhen Steve left \u0026hellip; and they came back looking for him, I went \u0026ldquo;you don\u0026rsquo;t need a string theorist! You need me.\u0026rdquo; So I showed up on set, \u0026hellip; I have no idea what my original instructions were, but apparently I did well enough that I then got invited to come back the next day, and the next day, and the next.\nVancouver is not just a city where a lot of SciFi films are made, it\u0026rsquo;s a city where a lot of unionized SciFi films are made. People leave \u0026hellip; and they remember who they worked with \u0026hellip; then work on other amazing shows. I end up working on all these other shows because someone has my cell phone number from ten years ago and I\u0026rsquo;ll get a call saying \u0026ldquo;Hey, can you show up on set, like, tomorrow?\u0026rdquo;\n Wow, you nailed the summary in the tweet. Right place and time plus maintaining a network! What was it like on set once you got there?\n One of the more unusual parts about this was because they want real math and they want real science, and there\u0026rsquo;s a script that gives you an idea of what the subject matter is. Mostly they\u0026rsquo;d give me instructions like \u0026ldquo;we need six feet of equations,\u0026rdquo; and I\u0026rsquo;d respond with \u0026ldquo;six feet of equations on what?\u0026rdquo; And they go \u0026ldquo;just six feet!\u0026rdquo;.\nI ended up doing a lot of things like, say, feed the energy of a solar flare into a black hole, which although mathematically valid, is just not something you\u0026rsquo;d ever do in real life. I got the opportunity to do generally novel mathematics.\nA lot of movies and TV shows will hire a specialist to do science at them and leave, but on Stargate I built up a relationship, one of trust. At the beginning, I was working for the property department (things actors would interact with), and I\u0026rsquo;d get lent out to the \u0026ldquo;set dec\u0026rdquo; (set decoration department), and maybe VFX (\u0026ldquo;video effects\u0026rdquo;) would need me for something.\nOver time, as I would reliably worked for them and was friendly, always answering questions between takes \u0026hellip; I came to understand that this is not a science lesson, it is a story with science in it, so story always comes first. We eventually came to the point where the writing department would come to me with something like \u0026ldquo;our starship is running out of oxygen, we need to go to an alien planet. How do they find the rocks they need to fix this?\u0026rdquo;\n What was your favorite prompt?\n [The writers came to me with], \u0026ldquo;we need an astrophysical big baddie that kills every body every twenty-two minutes,\u0026rdquo; which was by far my favorite thing I ever got to do at Stargate. Their original idea was a really slowly rotating pulsar.\nNow, a pulsar rotates on the order of milliseconds. A slow pulsar still rotates in milliseconds, so if you had one that rotated so its beam would cross every twenty-two minutes, the electromagnetic field would be about as deadly as holding refrigerator magnets and do cartwheels. Sure, it would generate an electromagnetic field, but it\u0026rsquo;s not one anyone would even notice, much less kill somebody.\nSo my idea was to have a \u0026ldquo;starving pulsar,\u0026rdquo; one right on the brink of being able to pulse and not pulse, and put it in a binary star system, where one feeder star would zip by really close to a bigger star, and sap off some of that plasma and dust\u0026hellip;\nAt the time we did this episode, we never saw a system like this in real life, but we did see that pulsars could be in binary system, and we knew there were such thing as an inactive pulsar, so we went \u0026ldquo;eh, this is plausible. why not?\u0026rdquo;\nThree years later, scientists found such a system1 in real life! So I was super proud that we hypothesized this in Stargate as a major plot point three years before it was discovered.\n I love the way you\u0026rsquo;re just like\u0026hellip; sneaking things into pop-culture this way. It\u0026rsquo;s so wonderfully subversive.\n Oh yeah, I have so many references to my friends\u0026rsquo; thesis work in various episodes of Stargate\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much that all my physics classmates have some sort of reference to their work somewhere on the blackboards.\n That is incredible! How many people are there in similar roles?\n Very very few, as far as I know. There have been Science Consultants for a long time, going back to Star Trek, before I was even born. But most people who do science consulting either do one show or movie and then never again, or they do a little bit of it and then transition into script writing.\nAs far as I can tell, I am the longest running one \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s been over a decade at this point \u0026hellip; and I\u0026rsquo;m still doing science consulting as opposed to script writing. There are a handful of other people working on high-profile shows, but there are very few women, and they usually just do one-off engagements. It\u0026rsquo;s not for a lack of want, it just seems that they haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to.\nA lot of people in science are deep fans of sci-fi, and it\u0026rsquo;s such a common idea that \u0026ldquo;if only they talked to me first, they could have fixed this idea.\u0026rdquo; But it turns out it is much easier to destroy than create\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s kind of a game of \u0026ldquo;yes-and\u0026rdquo; improvisation\u0026hellip; they\u0026rsquo;re going to do the story they\u0026rsquo;re going to do, and your job is to make it plausible. You will run into situations that may make you cringe a bit\u0026hellip;\n But it\u0026rsquo;s okay to sacrifice some scientific integrity for the sake of story.\n Yes, and that\u0026rsquo;s exactly where you have to be. You have to understand that story comes first. It\u0026rsquo;s all about the story and that we have some scientific plausibility there is great, but it is not the primary function of the show.\n And what would you suggest to those interested in Science Communication as far as conferences, organizations, etc?\n For those looking to get involved, the National Academies of Sciences \u0026ldquo;Entertainment Exchange\u0026rdquo; is a great place to start. It\u0026rsquo;s primarily one-off conversations, but it can lead to paid work. I consider it a great way to learn the process.\nFigure out how to teach quickly, get to the high-end stuff first so [the writers] can pick between options, and then start running down what the various consequences would be, what could be incorporated as story-telling elements. How does it also play out in the details and how are they part of the world-building?\nThose are the sorts of mindsets to put yourself in. As far as getting into the industry, look out for media fellowships and internships from organizations like the AGU, AAAS, The National Academies, AIP, and various other subject-specific groups. Many even offer discounted legal services for members that freelance science communicators should definitely try to take advantage of!\nSciComm Camp is an excellent event, and the National Association of Science Writers does a lot in this space. You can also look for local groups, and even volunteer to work with Creative Writing workshops to hone these kinds of skills.\n So there it is, put yourself in situations that facilitate networking, and maintain relationships you form in the industry. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave you with one of my favorite quotes from our conversation:\n My job is to be curious and excited in public, and it\u0026rsquo;s all just different facets of that job.\n  These rotated at 38 minute intervals! Which would have been perfect had the episodes been twice as long. ^   ","date":1552521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552521600,"objectID":"9b6bb93acd8ca8481e9f3b062f50d83d","permalink":"/post/mika/","publishdate":"2019-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mika/","section":"post","summary":"Ever wonder how shows and movies make sure their science is sound?","tags":["consulting","scicomm","s^3"],"title":"Scientist Spotlight Series: Mika McKinnon","type":"post"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":[],"content":"I ran into a problem while upgrading code from Python 2 to Python 3 that required me to downgrade matplotlib to version 2.2.3 in order to get the functionality in place (all tests were passing except for plotting).

Amazing slow-motion footage and great explanations of physics.\n  \nthebrainscoop Natural History done in a way I never thought would be as popular as it has become. It is now an inside look into the Field Museum (of Chicago) and shows what life in the field is like. Includes full-length animal dissections, complete with humorous commentary to deal with the morbidity (and the smell).\n  \nVeritasium A physist who has been at the science communication game since the early(ish) days of youtube.

Now retired (the title prevented it from being promoted on many publishing platforms due to the language). It is hilarious.\n  \nWendover Productions | Half as Interesting Half as Interesting started out as a recurring series on the first channel based on the concept of turning a set of esoteric Wikipedia pages into videos.

Jean-Paul Sartre experimented with mescaline in Paris in 1935 and found it distorted his visual perception for weeks. Houses appeared to have ‚Äúleering faces, all eyes and jaws,‚Äù clock faces looked like owls, and he saw crabs following him around all the time. These are much higher-level hallucinations than Kl√ºver‚Äôs simple form constants. ‚ÄúThe early stages of visual hallucination are very simple ‚Äî these geometric patterns,‚Äù Ermentrout said. But when higher cognitive functions kick in, such as memory, he said, ‚Äúyou start to see more complex hallucinations and you try and make sense of them. I believe that all you‚Äôre seeing is the spontaneous emergence of [stored memories] as the higher brain areas become more excited.‚Äù\n  Heinrich Kl√ºver classified the shapes he saw while under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs into four categories, known as ‚Äúform constants.‚Äù\n  Diagram showing how lines in the visual field (circular regions on the left) map to lines in the striate cortex, part of the visual cortex involved in directly processing visual information.\n You can download this article as a pdf.\n","date":1533513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533513600,"objectID":"a4ac950a611a181864723bfde97da84b","permalink":"/post/hallucinating/","publishdate":"2018-08-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hallucinating/","section":"post","summary":"A possible model to explain the visual field distortions perceived by those hallucinating","tags":[],"title":"The Mathematics of Hallucination","type":"post"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":["rnr"],"content":"250 steps in 12 direction(s) chosen from 1 possible step size(s).\n$$ s = .00000525, \\; $$ $$ | \\lbrace \\theta \\rbrace | = 12, $$ $$ | \\lbrace r \\rbrace | = 1,$$ $$ r_0 = 0.0000,$$ $$ R = 0.28, $$ $$r \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000), $$ $$\\theta \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000). $$\n","date":1533454595,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533454595,"objectID":"36a028f4c5f90f1c9e87b2db2051a347","permalink":"/artwork/rnr_walks_0000000525/","publishdate":"2018-08-05T07:36:35Z","relpermalink":"/artwork/rnr_walks_0000000525/","section":"artwork","summary":" ","tags":["random","walks"],"title":"Probably Art # 217: Walk","type":"artwork"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":["rnr"],"content":"91-sided polygon with vertices chosen from 5 distance(s) from the origin.\n$$ s = .01585734, \\; $$ $$ | \\lbrace \\theta \\rbrace | = 91, $$ $$ | \\lbrace r \\rbrace | = 5,$$ $$ r_0 = 0.2500,$$ $$ R = 1.00, $$ $$r \\sim \\beta(25.000, 38.000), $$ $$\\theta \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000). $$\n","date":1533426848,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533426848,"objectID":"b5afe3c9045e589269ae2d07aaddfedd","permalink":"/artwork/rnr_polygons_0001585734/","publishdate":"2018-08-04T23:54:08Z","relpermalink":"/artwork/rnr_polygons_0001585734/","section":"artwork","summary":" ","tags":["random","polygons"],"title":"Probably Art # 216: Polygon","type":"artwork"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Article: Learn Math for Machine Learning This article was one I found insightful and I agreed with most of its advice.

Challenge problems are what I thrive on.\nAs such, programming comprises the vast majority of the \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; that I do. Theories are nothing without evidence, and my laboratory is the computer. I am a computational scientist, being trained as a mathematician.\nProgramming has enabled me to do so much more than the research I perform as part of my dissertation work. One can argue that my most marketable skill after graduation will be my software development experience. Simply put, being able to program has opened up endless possibilities. \nAfter learning the first language, picking up others is much easier. I did not have formal instruction; rather I picked up style and knowledge piecemeal as I took on projects that interested me. What I have come to realize is that computers are really stupid. \nThe way I learned programming\u0026ndash;as a tool, rather than a language with which to instruct dumb machines\u0026ndash;made computers seem utterly magical. They are not. Computers are profoundly stupid.\nI finally came to understand that everything on a computer is pretty much just text files. All those fancy programming languages are just text files that in turn interpret other text files.\nAll those applications are just layers and layers of text files referencing one another and communicating with the brains of your computer.\nProgramming has opened up a door to the world of machines.\n\nThis is our superpower as humans. \nI learned to program as a problem-solving tool. This was life-changing on its own, and I fully encourage every student studying a science to learn some kind of programming language, even if only to familiarize oneself with the modality of thinking.\nBut I have to point out the inadequacy of all the \u0026ldquo;hiding of complexity\u0026rdquo; that occurs during the teaching of a programming language. I think it is worth spending a little time reviewing some very core fundamentals of how a computer operates.\nThese skills generalize to all languages, and should be able to enable a student to know just enough to be able to use the internet to search for what they need.\n\nLearning what question to ask is half the battle \nAnd I realize now that I spent so much wasted time in my life asking the wrong questions because I did not really understand how a computer works.\n\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all I was missing: the knowledge that computers are DUMB. And this finally brings me to the topic I want to discuss at length: how can we bridge the gap between the use of programming as a problem solving tool and the use of it as a means of communication with your machine.\nFor this reason, I encourage everyone to pick up a UNIX distribution and learn how to set up a programming environment in one to achieve whatever goal one may have.\nI realize this is a big ask for busy students, and the learning curve can be steep if there isn\u0026rsquo;t some amount of hand-holding and guidance. But \u0026hellip;\nit has a 10X reward,\n(I promise) ","date":1531526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531526400,"objectID":"8faf07145b88121c662da8e21e1a1d6f","permalink":"/post/skillsgap/","publishdate":"2018-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/skillsgap/","section":"post","summary":"Programming has enabled me to do so much more than the research I perform as part of my dissertation work.","tags":[],"title":"Bridging the Skills Gap","type":"post"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":["rnr"],"content":"3139 lines drawn through each origin in one of 7 direction(s) with lengths chosen from 1 size(s).\n$$ s = .01585163, \\;

I resented the forced pace of it all.\nI now have the vantage point of a teacher, and understand the difficulty of running a classroom that caters to a wide range of student capabilities and backgrounds. Group-work is a way that I now attempt to stimulate collaboration and force those who \u0026ldquo;get it\u0026rdquo; to examine their understanding by explaining it.\nBut I get it. Group-work can feel utterly repressive. What is it about the dynamics of the group\u0026rsquo;s formation that stifles productivity? What makes groups successful?\n Honda views collaboration from the vantage point of the individual, not the team. As the automaker sees it, the individual is more important than the group; his or her capabilities, decision making, knowledge, and creativity are the wellsprings from which a group‚Äôs performance ultimately emerges\u0026hellip;. Honda‚Äôs belief is that the organizational structure must serve to maximize the aptitude and skills of each individual; in turn, the team, the organization, will benefit.\n ‚Äî Driving Honda, Jeffrey Rothfeder, pp 133 In the context of this quote, the innovative corporate structure of the Honda Motor company allows for the strengths of each individual in a group to play off one another. The workers on the assembly line command the attention of top managers in the plant for even the smallest of screws out of place.\nThis is not because the company is interested in micromanaging.

I like to set deadlines for myself well ahead of the real ones just in case I want to make last minute revisions.\nDespite years of applying for/to all sorts of academia-related things, I still often end up working on final tweaks at the last minute. Who knows if these are beneficial or not?\nIn one sense, I\u0026rsquo;m a big believer in deadlines. Once something is submitted, it is completely off my mind and out of my control.\n However, what I really want to talk about is when deadlines impose on opportunities\n Particularly when it just happens out of circumstance.\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s say you find out about a college program that didn\u0026rsquo;t come up at all in your search (maybe it was classified differently, or under an unusual department). Or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s that scholarship solicitation that\u0026rsquo;s calling your name.\nIn all your excitement, you rush to the APPLY NOW button, only to find that (somehow despite the forms still being open), they are no longer accepting applications.\n What do you do in this situation? \n (I know what I would have done, I would have sighed and moved on.) \nHowever, I now believe that when the opportunity speaks to you, speak back.\nCall someone. Find a contact point and try reaching out. \nTry to find someone involved with whatever thing you are looking at, and get in touch.\nStay calm, express your interest (a little institutional flattery doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt), and ask if they would be willing to be gracious enough to consider you despite the deadline.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be amazed how often deadlines are totally arbitrary. \nOften they aren\u0026rsquo;t. Still, it is worth finding out.\nThis may be hyperbolic, but I\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and say it on the record:\n No one (worth working with) turns down great talent because of a deadline. \nNeil Gaiman said in his Make Good Art Commencement Address that as far as successful employment goes (in the arts and freelancing), you must be\n Good On Time, and Likeable  But fortunately, you only need two of these three. I now quote Mr. Gaiman directly:\n People will tolerate how unpleasant you are if your work is good and you deliver it on time.\nPeople will forgive the lateness of your work if its good and they like you.\nAnd you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be as good if you\u0026rsquo;re on time and it\u0026rsquo;s always a pleasure to hear from you.\n If you are a good candidate and can get someone to vouch for you, you can get around a deadline (from time to time).\nMore Details \nThere are times when not enough good applications have come in, and committee members send out emails to their colleagues soliciting new submissions well past the deadlines.\nAdvertising emails go unsent, attention wavers, and sometimes plain oversight just gets the best of us.\n You simply never know what\u0026rsquo;s actually going on, especially in an academic department  \nSo it it always worth trying to reach out to someone and asking if you can submit something past a deadline.\nI have far more than my fair share of anecdotal evidence to support this. I do not hold that this is indicative of academic disciplines in general, just that trying to reach out is a low risk action for a high potential reward.\nIt is irresponsible to not try.

It can mean the difference between being lost and being directed in a productive manner.\nMaybe I got lucky, but my present advisor has rarely let me go in a research direction that didn\u0026rsquo;t bear fruit of some kind or another. He knew when to shield me from complexity and when to implore me to pursue deeper understanding.\n So how might one go about finding such a person?\n Start locally. Look at the professors doing research in your school (it\u0026rsquo;s all on their website). Anyone that looks interesting to you, take note of their office hours and email. Show up or send them a short email expressing that you would like to meet to discuss their research.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all it takes to get started. This can make such an unbelievable difference.\n\nA story to illustrate my point A friend and I were accepted to graduate school the same year. They took the offer package as it was presented. I asked if it would be possible to arrange a summer job so I could get rooted in Denver, and I got one. I shared this with my friend.\n Wait, all you did was ask?\nYup. Politely hinted at how much it would help me and how grateful I would be.\n So they tried it, shot an email batch to several professors, and booked a cheap budget-airline flight to go see the professors in person and scope out housing.\nThey walked away with a $2000 salary bonus for becoming a research assistant in place of a teaching assistant. Turns out a professor had funds available and was looking for someone new. My friend happened to be the first to ask.\nIn both our cases, money was on the table that we weren\u0026rsquo;t aware of until we had the audacity to ask for what we wanted (politely, with some tact).\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s how it starts. By reaching out to the human behind the web profile and talking to them, seeing how you get along. That relationship is one of the most important ones in your life if you choose to pursue a doctorate. As with any relationship, it needs to be rooted in trust and mutual respect. Which is not something you can assess without talking to them in person.\n\nIn Summary \nIt all starts with an introduction and a show of curiosity. Explore different topics, you never know what you will find. When I arrived in graduate school, I was dead set on one particular area and completely assured I would avoid another.\n My bias was so bad that when I was first introduced to my advisor, I mentally checked out when I heard mention of the topic I \u0026ldquo;knew\u0026rdquo; I was avoiding.\n It was only after taking his classes and spending time with him in the moments before/after and in office hours that I began to like his style (despite it being very different than mine), and how well it suited my pace of learning.\nHe is the best math teacher I have ever had to date, so when he expressed interest in hiring me for the summer, I accepted, trusting he would ease me in to the topics I (thought I) despised (but actually turned out to love). Spending time with those you look up to is essential for your own growth.\n TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHILE IN SCHOOL.\n (Starting with the names of your professors, and then their colleagues, and then what they do, etc. We\u0026rsquo;re a friendly bunch, I swear.)\n","date":1517788800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517788800,"objectID":"17f69f69c33ba1d74a116490ea01025b","permalink":"/post/advising3/","publishdate":"2018-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/advising3/","section":"post","summary":"You have to find someone you want to learn from.","tags":["advising"],"title":"The Importance of Good Advising: Part 3","type":"post"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":["rnr"],"content":"285 lines drawn through each origin in one of 2 direction(s) with lengths chosen from 6 size(s).\n$$ s = .00241148, \\; $$ $$ | \\lbrace \\theta \\rbrace | = 2, $$ $$ | \\lbrace r \\rbrace | = 6,$$ $$ r_0 = 0.0000,$$ $$ R = 3.00, $$ $$r \\sim \\beta(15.000, 102.000), $$ $$\\theta \\sim \\beta(5.000, 4.000). $$\n","date":1517726654,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517726654,"objectID":"3a2907ef19edd198007becafcfcd5007","permalink":"/artwork/rnr_lines_0000241148/","publishdate":"2018-02-04T06:44:14Z","relpermalink":"/artwork/rnr_lines_0000241148/","section":"artwork","summary":" ","tags":["random","lines"],"title":"Probably Art # 35: Line","type":"artwork"},{"authors":[],"categories":["academia"],"content":" Getting to Grad School As an undergraduate, I first experienced the extent to which mathematics could be broadly applied to \u0026ldquo;real world\u0026rdquo; problems, and recognized the potential to make substantive change. I set my sights on a job in industry, with vague hopes and aspirations as to what such a thing might look like. I had been applying to summer programs that would potentially expose me to application areas every.single.year. with no luck.\nCome April of my junior year, another round of rejection letters once again rolled in, and I found myself discussing the matter with a professor who had become a close mentor. Likely sensing my frustration, she brought up the subject of me looking into graduate school, knowing it would provide me with the exposure I was seeking.\n I can\u0026rsquo;t afford that, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to take on the debt involved.\n That was my perspective. I have no doubt that this exact fear is shared by many of my generation who have witnessed the crippling effects of the financial recession on their parents. The takeaway was that debt was to be avoided at all costs.\n You know they\u0026rsquo;ll pay for it, right?\n \u0026gt;Who'll pay for it? You see my luck with funding..   No, graduate students in STEM fields often have their entire degrees paid for, including a stipend. It\u0026rsquo;s like\u0026hellip; how PhD\u0026rsquo;s work.\n \u0026gt;... What?  How was I only finding out about this after three years of education?\nWhy didn\u0026rsquo;t they lead with this on my first day of school?\nWould that not have changed how I thought about the coursework I was taking? Why was this option, this opportunity only entering my realm of awareness now? This late in the game, with graduation around the corner.\nTHIS IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM. In many ways I have always been an ideal candidate for graduate school. Endlessly curious from a young age, I have often spent my \u0026ldquo;free time\u0026rdquo; in the pursuit of more knowledge. In every type of science.\nThe opportunity to spend several years developing intellectual maturity by truly delving deep into a subject was perfect for someone who spent so much time developing a shallow but expansive knowledge-base.\nThe fact that someone like myself was unaware of this opportunity (despite so much researching and time spent in office hours), until practically months before applications began, is a problem.\nTHIS IS NOT HOW OUR HIGHER INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE FUNCTIONING.\nI went to a small school, where I was able to get a lot of individualized attention when I needed it. I was taking the right steps and I still can attribute almost all of where I am to a little luck and being in the right place at the right time. I course-corrected and started planning for graduate school immediately. There was no time to dwell on all the fellowships, grants, and applications I had already missed. (Though, apparently, deadlines aren\u0026rsquo;t always deadlines\u0026hellip; but\u0026hellip; more on that in a future post).\nIn graduate school, I spent a lot of energy passionately talking with any and every undergraduate about the opportunities available to them, and what they could be doing earlier on.\n I needed to tell everybody about the opportunities I missed. I still do not feel like I have made any substantive impact in that regard.\n Only one person (that I am aware of) has gone to graduate school because they heard about the whole \u0026ldquo;it can be free\u0026rdquo; thing from me.

Orientation blew my mind. When my group was surveyed regarding where we were academically, I realized that graduate students made up something like a tenth of the room.\n Wait\u0026hellip; how did these kids get jobs here so early on?\n I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know national labs were a thing until like a year before. Let\u0026rsquo;s not even get into that being a problem.\nWhen the high school students raised their hands, I almost lost it.\n HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?! I hardly knew anything coming out of high school, let alone that opportunities like this existed.\n How was it that these students were three, four, even seven years ahead of where I was in regards to their connections? Simply knowing someone involved in research at a national lab can be the difference between working summers in pizzerias and fast-fashion retailers (yes, I\u0026rsquo;m speaking from personal experience), and building a network on which an entire career\u0026rsquo;s foundation can rest.\nI was quite aware of the inequality of opportunity in America, but this was something else. I considered myself unbelievably fortunate to have had the academic guidance I had received in my life. I was aware that I would not be here today at all in the first place if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the advice of my academic advisors and mentors. If I was lucky, what were students who were years ahead of me? Super lucky?\nWHAT GIVES? I have been thinking a lot recently about the extent to which serendipity and luck has has such a profound impact on my academic pursuits. I love where I have ended up. I am so incredibly happy in graduate school, but I was completely unaware of this option until a somewhat unreasonably late time. I am interested in exploring the role that luck played into my present circumstances. I want to understand what it was that made the ultimate difference for me. I need to understand, so that I may more effectively communicate these opportunities to those early in their academic careers.\n Students need to know about what is possible for them. NEARLY EVERY TIME I BRING UP TO PEOPLE THAT I GET PAID TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL, I AM MET WITH DISBELIEF.\n Why is it that so many are unaware that these* opportunities exist?\n WHERE IS THE FAILURE IN COMMUNICATION?\n *(let alone many many many others)\nAre we really getting our best and brightest into graduate school? Or would something like shyness inhibit someone from finding out, simply because they never went to office hours and had someone tell them?\nI will begin to explore these questions by retracing my own path to graduate school and looking for instances where earlier intervention may have made a substantive difference in my preparation.

This is related to the integral mission of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) as well as the CU Denver Math Club. We want to demonstrate to people that our field doesn‚Äôt have to feel like an esoteric and unfamiliar place, especially owing to its widespread prevalence in people‚Äôs lives, which goes unnoticed.\nThis provides a benefit to students in more ways than one. They will get lots of free artistic material of their own creation to take home with them. Ideally, they will feel empowered by their new familiarity with mathematics. Students will also get fed well, have fun, and walk away knowing about the resources available through the clubs to learn more. As a collaborative effort between these two clubs, Inworks, and the Department of Mathematics, this event will demonstrate the power of interdisciplinary approaches to community outreach. Each station will focus on engaging students with art and providing an educational component.\nAfter some time for eating and crowds to settle in, the event will open with a brief lecture by an artist who created the intricate display visible in front of the elevators on the 4th floor of the Student Commons Building. He is in his sixties and does not have an internet presence, but you can see his work for yourselves with a quick visit to the math department or google ‚ÄúPlatonic and Archimedean solids.‚Äù Then we will transition to students making art for themselves at our five stations, located around the spacious Inworks facilities. For detailed information regarding each station, including the \u0026ldquo;teachable moments\u0026rdquo; possible at each one, see the Budget section.\n Stations TENSEGRITY Sculpture that use tension and gravity alone to remain upright. (see here for a famous example).\n Teachable Moments: math/physics of gravity, tension, Hook‚Äôs law, structural integrity, engineering considerations when building (applied mathematics in action).\n ORIGAMI Speaks for itself. Lots of diagrams printed out to guide students (so they don‚Äôt necessarily need to follow along with the station coordinator‚Äôs example and can work on their own if they prefer)\n Teachable Moment: Some mathematicians developed a ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù to describe folding and started publishing (somewhat humorous) papers on origami. Years later, this started being used for application to heat-responsive materials, self-folding structures, computational protein folding modeling, and more. You never know where curiosity with mathematics can lead. Often the theory is done for its own sake and applications follow later.\n TILING Triangular wooden tiles imprinted with envelope curves used to make beautiful sweeping designs\n Teachable Moment: History of mathematics in the Islamic world, use of symmetry and tiling in architecture (both then and now), which shapes can ‚Äútile the plane‚Äù and which cannot (e.g. a hexagon is the largest shape that can do so before you have to start using two shapes. This can be intuited with tactile play, or by formal proof, mathematics as a language to describe ideas.\n GRAPH THEORY AND INTEGER SEQUENCES This one kind of needs to be seen to be understood. ‚ÄúTurning numbers into pretty pictures‚Äù is the best we could describe it. It‚Äôs very cool.\n Teachable Moment: Take these things that people generally just regard as lists of numbers, and decide on a way to interpret them as instructions for a drawing. Repetition and rule-following can lead to surprisingly pleasing results. This can effectively teach anyone to make really intricate designs very easily and very quickly, and arises from an unexpected place.\n RANDOM ART This builds on the aforementioned event by extending the idea of rule-following for visual complexity to random numbers.\n Teachable Moment: randomness is NOT disorder. Lots of lessons on probability here (this station will likely be staffed with more mathematics students than others. Similar lessons to the above, just extended to probability/random sequences.\n The event was funded by grants from the Student Government Association and CU Denver Live!, with space and equipment generously donated by Inworks. It was organized as a joint effort by the CU Denver SIAM Student Chapter, Math Club, and the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences.\nIt was held on 04/20/2017. A few pictures of the event can be found below:\n \u0026ldquo;A picture is worth a thousand words. A model is worth a thousand pictures\u0026rdquo;\n             ","date":1492646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1492646400,"objectID":"15667b3f5551a9e040f26790284a7317","permalink":"/post/mathart/","publishdate":"2017-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mathart/","section":"post","summary":"Math or Art?: An event","tags":["art","events"],"title":"Math || Art","type":"post"}]
