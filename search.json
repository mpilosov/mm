Daily news show and several subject-specific branches (psych, space, kids).\n  \n  \n3Blue1Brown The most beautiful (visual and audio) mathematics videos on the planet.\n  \nVsauce Hard to define what this is\u0026hellip; But it is INCREDIBLY addictingly good and thought-provoking.\n  \nSmarterEveryDay A rocket engineer trying to make sure he learns alongside his four children on a daily basis. Amazing slow-motion footage and great explanations of physics.\n  \nthebrainscoop Natural History done in a way I never thought would be as popular as it has become. It is now an inside look into the Field Museum (of Chicago) and shows what life in the field is like. Includes full-length animal dissections, complete with humorous commentary to deal with the morbidity (and the smell).\n  \nVeritasium A physist who has been at the science communication game since the early(ish) days of youtube. He has a broad audience and has a knack for going viral.\n  \n  \nHFS Podcast (filmed and uploaded to youtube). Now retired (the title prevented it from being promoted on many publishing platforms due to the language). It is hilarious.\n  \nWendover Productions | Half as Interesting Half as Interesting started out as a recurring series on the first channel based on the concept of turning a set of esoteric Wikipedia pages into videos. Most are transportation (train, plane, car, etc.) themed, which sounds boring, I know.\n  \n  \nWe can learn a lot from this channel, which manages to rack up a lot of views with only stock footage (and a good script).\n","date":1535328000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535328000,"objectID":"4bc8b01c60761e8afd7546645a09c3dd","permalink":"https://www.mathematicalmichael.com/resources/scicomm/","publishdate":"2018-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/scicomm/","section":"resources","summary":"Striking a balance between information and entertainment is difficult.

I just had to post it here for posterity.\nFrom Quanta Magazine:\n There is still much more to understand about hallucinations. Jean-Paul Sartre experimented with mescaline in Paris in 1935 and found it distorted his visual perception for weeks. Houses appeared to have “leering faces, all eyes and jaws,” clock faces looked like owls, and he saw crabs following him around all the time. These are much higher-level hallucinations than Klüver’s simple form constants. “The early stages of visual hallucination are very simple — these geometric patterns,” Ermentrout said. But when higher cognitive functions kick in, such as memory, he said, “you start to see more complex hallucinations and you try and make sense of them. I believe that all you’re seeing is the spontaneous emergence of [stored memories] as the higher brain areas become more excited.”\n  Heinrich Klüver classified the shapes he saw while under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs into four categories, known as “form constants.”\n  Diagram showing how lines in the visual field (circular regions on the left) map to lines in the striate cortex, part of the visual cortex involved in directly processing visual information.\n You can download this article as a pdf.\n","date":1533535200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533535200,"objectID":"d706becda75673c2312387f78475367e","permalink":"https://www.mathematicalmichael.com/post/hallucinating/","publishdate":"2018-08-06T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/post/hallucinating/","section":"post","summary":"A possible model to explain the visual field distortions perceived by those hallucinating","tags":[],"title":"The Mathematics of Hallucination","type":"post"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":["rnr"],"content":"250 steps in 12 direction(s) chosen from 1 possible step size(s).\n$$ s = .00000525, \\; $$ $$ | \\lbrace \\theta \\rbrace | = 12, $$ $$ | \\lbrace r \\rbrace | = 1,$$ $$ r_0 = 0.0000,$$ $$ R = 0.28, $$ $$r \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000), $$ $$\\theta \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000). $$\n","date":1533476195,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533476195,"objectID":"7d373c54a9e2a43169295a5d957f942e","permalink":"https://www.mathematicalmichael.com/artwork/rnr_walks_0000000525/","publishdate":"2018-08-05T07:36:35-06:00","relpermalink":"/artwork/rnr_walks_0000000525/","section":"artwork","summary":" ","tags":["random","walks"],"title":"Random || Not Random # 217: Walk","type":"artwork"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":["rnr"],"content":"91-sided polygon with vertices chosen from 5 distance(s) from the origin.\n$$ s = .01585734, \\; $$ $$ | \\lbrace \\theta \\rbrace | = 91, $$ $$ | \\lbrace r \\rbrace | = 5,$$ $$ r_0 = 0.2500,$$ $$ R = 1.00, $$ $$r \\sim \\beta(25.000, 38.000), $$ $$\\theta \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000). $$\n","date":1533448448,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533448448,"objectID":"ae3d818807bf5ed76fa698ec564dea80","permalink":"https://www.mathematicalmichael.com/artwork/rnr_polygons_0001585734/","publishdate":"2018-08-04T23:54:08-06:00","relpermalink":"/artwork/rnr_polygons_0001585734/","section":"artwork","summary":" ","tags":["random","polygons"],"title":"Random || Not Random # 216: Polygon","type":"artwork"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Article: Learn Math for Machine Learning This article was one I found insightful and I agreed with most of its advice.

The regularization impacts all directions of the posterior since we effectively balance the data mismatch with our prior beliefs.

Challenge problems are what I thrive on.\nAs such, programming comprises the vast majority of the \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; that I do. Theories are nothing without evidence, and my laboratory is the computer. I am a computational scientist, being trained as a mathematician.\nProgramming has enabled me to do so much more than the research I perform as part of my dissertation work. One can argue that my most marketable skill after graduation will be my software development experience. Simply put, being able to program has opened up endless possibilities. \nAfter learning the first language, picking up others is much easier. I did not have formal instruction; rather I picked up style and knowledge piecemeal as I took on projects that interested me. What I have come to realize is that computers are really stupid. \nThe way I learned programming\u0026ndash;as a tool, rather than a language with which to instruct dumb machines\u0026ndash;made computers seem utterly magical. They are not. Computers are profoundly stupid.\nI finally came to understand that everything on a computer is pretty much just text files. All those fancy programming languages are just text files that in turn interpret other text files.\nAll those applications are just layers and layers of text files referencing one another and communicating with the brains of your computer.\nProgramming has opened up a door to the world of machines.\n\nThis is our superpower as humans. \nI learned to program as a problem-solving tool. This was life-changing on its own, and I fully encourage every student studying a science to learn some kind of programming language, even if only to familiarize oneself with the modality of thinking.\nBut I have to point out the inadequacy of all the \u0026ldquo;hiding of complexity\u0026rdquo; that occurs during the teaching of a programming language. I think it is worth spending a little time reviewing some very core fundamentals of how a computer operates.\nThese skills generalize to all languages, and should be able to enable a student to know just enough to be able to use the internet to search for what they need.\n\nLearning what question to ask is half the battle \nAnd I realize now that I spent so much wasted time in my life asking the wrong questions because I did not really understand how a computer works.\n\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all I was missing: the knowledge that computers are DUMB. And this finally brings me to the topic I want to discuss at length: how can we bridge the gap between the use of programming as a problem solving tool and the use of it as a means of communication with your machine.\nFor this reason, I encourage everyone to pick up a UNIX distribution and learn how to set up a programming environment in one to achieve whatever goal one may have.\nI realize this is a big ask for busy students, and the learning curve can be steep if there isn\u0026rsquo;t some amount of hand-holding and guidance.

A general goal is to configure the sensors so that they provide useful information for the stochastic inverse problem over the full duration of the experiment and provide us with minimally redundant data. We use a recently developed Consistent Bayesian framework for formulating and solving stochastic inverse problems to investigate several design criteria and objectives for deploying sensors. We draw comparisons to other approaches and results based on more classical statistical Bayesian formulations.","tags":[],"title":"Optimal Experimental Design of Time Series Data in a Consistent Bayesian Framework","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":["rnr"],"content":"250 steps in 10 direction(s) chosen from 1 possible step size(s).\n$$ s = .03486594, \\; $$ $$ | \\lbrace \\theta \\rbrace | = 10, $$ $$ | \\lbrace r \\rbrace | = 1,$$ $$ r_0 = 0.0000,$$ $$ R = 0.36, $$ $$r \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000), $$ $$\\theta \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000). $$\n","date":1522542134,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522542134,"objectID":"c9007f456666401f2e3c0e79f7c04783","permalink":"https://www.mathematicalmichael.com/artwork/rnr_walks_0003486594/","publishdate":"2018-03-31T18:22:14-06:00","relpermalink":"/artwork/rnr_walks_0003486594/","section":"artwork","summary":" ","tags":["random","walks"],"title":"Random || Not Random # 90: Walk","type":"artwork"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":["rnr"],"content":"250 steps in 12 direction(s) chosen from 1 possible step size(s).\n$$ s = .02199415, \\; $$ $$ | \\lbrace \\theta \\rbrace | = 12, $$ $$ | \\lbrace r \\rbrace | = 1,$$ $$ r_0 = 0.0000,$$ $$ R = 0.85, $$ $$r \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000), $$ $$\\theta \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000). $$\n","date":1522417515,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522417515,"objectID":"5026d36e41c2a7d5cb4e82faa8bb36cd","permalink":"https://www.mathematicalmichael.com/artwork/rnr_walks_0002199415/","publishdate":"2018-03-30T07:45:15-06:00","relpermalink":"/artwork/rnr_walks_0002199415/","section":"artwork","summary":" ","tags":["random","walks"],"title":"Random || Not Random # 89: Walk","type":"artwork"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":["rnr"],"content":"250 steps in 12 direction(s) chosen from 1 possible step size(s).\n$$ s = .00068959, \\; $$ $$ | \\lbrace \\theta \\rbrace | = 12, $$ $$ | \\lbrace r \\rbrace | = 1,$$ $$ r_0 = 0.0000,$$ $$ R = 0.30, $$ $$r \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000), $$ $$\\theta \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000). $$\n","date":1522328195,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522328195,"objectID":"d727076e31d8dbb37924b863f31d8b64","permalink":"https://www.mathematicalmichael.com/artwork/rnr_walks_0000068959/","publishdate":"2018-03-29T06:56:35-06:00","relpermalink":"/artwork/rnr_walks_0000068959/","section":"artwork","summary":" ","tags":["random","walks"],"title":"Random || Not Random # 88: Walk","type":"artwork"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":["rnr"],"content":"250 steps in 6 direction(s) chosen from 67 possible step size(s).\n$$ s = .00195467, \\; $$ $$ | \\lbrace \\theta \\rbrace | = 6, $$ $$ | \\lbrace r \\rbrace | = 67,$$ $$ r_0 = 0.0000,$$ $$ R = 0.27, $$ $$r \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000), $$ $$\\theta \\sim \\beta(1.000, 1.000). $$\n","date":1522226964,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522226964,"objectID":"36058c4f82e612b190a2cb035d420a3d","permalink":"https://www.mathematicalmichael.com/artwork/rnr_walks_0000195467/","publishdate":"2018-03-28T02:49:24-06:00","relpermalink":"/artwork/rnr_walks_0000195467/","section":"artwork","summary":" ","tags":["random","walks"],"title":"Random || Not Random # 87: Walk","type":"artwork"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Reading List: The Mathematics of Machine Learning\nReal-Time Object Recognition (YOLO)\nMachine Learning is Fun!

For scientific computing, Python is just more preferable overall Given some time, I can bind C libraries to Python wrappers if need be I can manipulate an existing codebase, but writing one from scratch is a poor use of my time and skillsets at this point (I would rather collaborate with someone more proficient in the language)  R  I have used it a lot over the years but these days prefer Python for anything that I would have once done in R Basically, if asked, I could translate ConsistentBayes into a non-optimized R-library in a couple weeks, I would just prefer not to  Wolfram  I use WolframAlpha (free) a bit, but I resist learning it because I cannot afford their licenses I wish nothing more than for them to open their code base.

I resented the forced pace of it all.\nI now have the vantage point of a teacher, and understand the difficulty of running a classroom that caters to a wide range of student capabilities and backgrounds. Group-work is a way that I now attempt to stimulate collaboration and force those who \u0026ldquo;get it\u0026rdquo; to examine their understanding by explaining it.\nBut I get it. Group-work can feel utterly repressive. What is it about the dynamics of the group\u0026rsquo;s formation that stifles productivity? What makes groups successful?\n Honda views collaboration from the vantage point of the individual, not the team. As the automaker sees it, the individual is more important than the group; his or her capabilities, decision making, knowledge, and creativity are the wellsprings from which a group’s performance ultimately emerges\u0026hellip;. Honda’s belief is that the organizational structure must serve to maximize the aptitude and skills of each individual; in turn, the team, the organization, will benefit.\n — Driving Honda, Jeffrey Rothfeder, pp 133 In the context of this quote, the innovative corporate structure of the Honda Motor company allows for the strengths of each individual in a group to play off one another. The workers on the assembly line command the attention of top managers in the plant for even the smallest of screws out of place.\nThis is not because the company is interested in micromanaging. Rather, it has instilled in its roots a profound respect for the expertise of the individual.\nThe managers inspect problems because they respect the authority of the assembly worker who deals with the process every day. Everyone is expected to be a master of their craft and contribute to the quality of the product.\nA team is nothing without the autonomy and expertise of the individuals within it. Mutual respect can only occur in the context of each member pursuing that which they are uniquely suited for.\n","date":1519628400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519628400,"objectID":"8aa7de06a0d9af8b8b4339c62129974a","permalink":"https://www.mathematicalmichael.com/post/honda/","publishdate":"2018-02-26T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/honda/","section":"post","summary":"There has always been something about group-work in school that I resisted during childhood.

I like to set deadlines for myself well ahead of the real ones just in case I want to make last minute revisions.\nDespite years of applying for/to all sorts of academia-related things, I still often end up working on final tweaks at the last minute. Who knows if these are beneficial or not?\nIn one sense, I\u0026rsquo;m a big believer in deadlines. Once something is submitted, it is completely off my mind and out of my control.\n However, what I really want to talk about is when deadlines impose on opportunities\n Particularly when it just happens out of circumstance.\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s say you find out about a college program that didn\u0026rsquo;t come up at all in your search (maybe it was classified differently, or under an unusual department). Or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s that scholarship solicitation that\u0026rsquo;s calling your name.\nIn all your excitement, you rush to the APPLY NOW button, only to find that (somehow despite the forms still being open), they are no longer accepting applications.\n What do you do in this situation? \n (I know what I would have done, I would have sighed and moved on.) \nHowever, I now believe that when the opportunity speaks to you, speak back.\nCall someone. Find a contact point and try reaching out. \nTry to find someone involved with whatever thing you are looking at, and get in touch.\nStay calm, express your interest (a little institutional flattery doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt), and ask if they would be willing to be gracious enough to consider you despite the deadline.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be amazed how often deadlines are totally arbitrary. \nOften they aren\u0026rsquo;t. Still, it is worth finding out.\nThis may be hyperbolic, but I\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and say it on the record:\n No one (worth working with) turns down great talent because of a deadline. \nNeil Gaiman said in his Make Good Art Commencement Address that as far as successful employment goes (in the arts and freelancing), you must be\n Good On Time, and Likeable  But fortunately, you only need two of these three. I now quote Mr. Gaiman directly:\n People will tolerate how unpleasant you are if your work is good and you deliver it on time.\nPeople will forgive the lateness of your work if its good and they like you.\nAnd you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be as good if you\u0026rsquo;re on time and it\u0026rsquo;s always a pleasure to hear from you.\n If you are a good candidate and can get someone to vouch for you, you can get around a deadline (from time to time).\nMore Details \nThere are times when not enough good applications have come in, and committee members send out emails to their colleagues soliciting new submissions well past the deadlines.\nAdvertising emails go unsent, attention wavers, and sometimes plain oversight just gets the best of us.\n You simply never know what\u0026rsquo;s actually going on, especially in an academic department  \nSo it it always worth trying to reach out to someone and asking if you can submit something past a deadline.\nI have far more than my fair share of anecdotal evidence to support this. I do not hold that this is indicative of academic disciplines in general, just that trying to reach out is a low risk action for a high potential reward.\nIt is irresponsible to not try.

It can mean the difference between being lost and being directed in a productive manner.\nMaybe I got lucky, but my present advisor has rarely let me go in a research direction that didn\u0026rsquo;t bear fruit of some kind or another. He knew when to shield me from complexity and when to implore me to pursue deeper understanding.\n So how might one go about finding such a person?\n Start locally. Look at the professors doing research in your school (it\u0026rsquo;s all on their website). Anyone that looks interesting to you, take note of their office hours and email. Show up or send them a short email expressing that you would like to meet to discuss their research.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all it takes to get started. This can make such an unbelievable difference.\n\nA story to illustrate my point A friend and I were accepted to graduate school the same year. They took the offer package as it was presented. I asked if it would be possible to arrange a summer job so I could get rooted in Denver, and I got one. I shared this with my friend.\n Wait, all you did was ask?\nYup. Politely hinted at how much it would help me and how grateful I would be.\n So they tried it, shot an email batch to several professors, and booked a cheap budget-airline flight to go see the professors in person and scope out housing.\nThey walked away with a $2000 salary bonus for becoming a research assistant in place of a teaching assistant. Turns out a professor had funds available and was looking for someone new. My friend happened to be the first to ask.\nIn both our cases, money was on the table that we weren\u0026rsquo;t aware of until we had the audacity to ask for what we wanted (politely, with some tact).\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s how it starts. By reaching out to the human behind the web profile and talking to them, seeing how you get along. That relationship is one of the most important ones in your life if you choose to pursue a doctorate. As with any relationship, it needs to be rooted in trust and mutual respect. Which is not something you can assess without talking to them in person.\n\nIn Summary \nIt all starts with an introduction and a show of curiosity. Explore different topics, you never know what you will find. When I arrived in graduate school, I was dead set on one particular area and completely assured I would avoid another.\n My bias was so bad that when I was first introduced to my advisor, I mentally checked out when I heard mention of the topic I \u0026ldquo;knew\u0026rdquo; I was avoiding.\n It was only after taking his classes and spending time with him in the moments before/after and in office hours that I began to like his style (despite it being very different than mine), and how well it suited my pace of learning.\nHe is the best math teacher I have ever had to date, so when he expressed interest in hiring me for the summer, I accepted, trusting he would ease me in to the topics I (thought I) despised (but actually turned out to love). Spending time with those you look up to is essential for your own growth.\n TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHILE IN SCHOOL.\n (Starting with the names of your professors, and then their colleagues, and then what they do, etc. We\u0026rsquo;re a friendly bunch, I swear.)\n","date":1517814000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517814000,"objectID":"92766f4d536948d58455b96a0dbde605","permalink":"https://www.mathematicalmichael.com/post/advising3/","publishdate":"2018-02-05T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/advising3/","section":"post","summary":"You have to find someone you want to learn from.","tags":["advising"],"title":"The Importance of Good Advising: Part 3","type":"post"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":["rnr"],"content":"285 lines drawn through each origin in one of 2 direction(s) with lengths chosen from 6 size(s).\n$$ s = .00241148, \\; $$ $$ | \\lbrace \\theta \\rbrace | = 2, $$ $$ | \\lbrace r \\rbrace | = 6,$$ $$ r_0 = 0.0000,$$ $$ R = 3.00, $$ $$r \\sim \\beta(15.000, 102.000), $$ $$\\theta \\sim \\beta(5.000, 4.000). $$\n","date":1517751854,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517751854,"objectID":"dd4bf12faef169510a2cfe52cdd18979","permalink":"https://www.mathematicalmichael.com/artwork/rnr_lines_0000241148/","publishdate":"2018-02-04T06:44:14-07:00","relpermalink":"/artwork/rnr_lines_0000241148/","section":"artwork","summary":" ","tags":["random","lines"],"title":"Random || Not Random # 35: Line","type":"artwork"},{"authors":[],"categories":["academia"],"content":" Getting to Grad School As an undergraduate, I first experienced the extent to which mathematics could be broadly applied to \u0026ldquo;real world\u0026rdquo; problems, and recognized the potential to make substantive change. I set my sights on a job in industry, with vague hopes and aspirations as to what such a thing might look like. I had been applying to summer programs that would potentially expose me to application areas every.single.year. with no luck.\nCome April of my junior year, another round of rejection letters once again rolled in, and I found myself discussing the matter with a professor who had become a close mentor. Likely sensing my frustration, she brought up the subject of me looking into graduate school, knowing it would provide me with the exposure I was seeking.\n I can\u0026rsquo;t afford that, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to take on the debt involved.\n That was my perspective. I have no doubt that this exact fear is shared by many of my generation who have witnessed the crippling effects of the financial recession on their parents. The takeaway was that debt was to be avoided at all costs.\n You know they\u0026rsquo;ll pay for it, right?\n \u0026gt;Who'll pay for it? You see my luck with funding..   No, graduate students in STEM fields often have their entire degrees paid for, including a stipend. It\u0026rsquo;s like\u0026hellip; how PhD\u0026rsquo;s work.\n \u0026gt;... What?  How was I only finding out about this after three years of education?\nWhy didn\u0026rsquo;t they lead with this on my first day of school?\nWould that not have changed how I thought about the coursework I was taking? Why was this option, this opportunity only entering my realm of awareness now? This late in the game, with graduation around the corner.\nTHIS IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM. In many ways I have always been an ideal candidate for graduate school. Endlessly curious from a young age, I have often spent my \u0026ldquo;free time\u0026rdquo; in the pursuit of more knowledge. In every type of science.\nThe opportunity to spend several years developing intellectual maturity by truly delving deep into a subject was perfect for someone who spent so much time developing a shallow but expansive knowledge-base.\nThe fact that someone like myself was unaware of this opportunity (despite so much researching and time spent in office hours), until practically months before applications began, is a problem.\nTHIS IS NOT HOW OUR HIGHER INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE FUNCTIONING.\nI went to a small school, where I was able to get a lot of individualized attention when I needed it. I was taking the right steps and I still can attribute almost all of where I am to a little luck and being in the right place at the right time. I course-corrected and started planning for graduate school immediately. There was no time to dwell on all the fellowships, grants, and applications I had already missed.

Orientation blew my mind. When my group was surveyed regarding where we were academically, I realized that graduate students made up something like a tenth of the room.\n Wait\u0026hellip; how did these kids get jobs here so early on?\n I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know national labs were a thing until like a year before. Let\u0026rsquo;s not even get into that being a problem.\nWhen the high school students raised their hands, I almost lost it.\n HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?! I hardly knew anything coming out of high school, let alone that opportunities like this existed.\n How was it that these students were three, four, even seven years ahead of where I was in regards to their connections? Simply knowing someone involved in research at a national lab can be the difference between working summers in pizzerias and fast-fashion retailers (yes, I\u0026rsquo;m speaking from personal experience), and building a network on which an entire career\u0026rsquo;s foundation can rest.\nI was quite aware of the inequality of opportunity in America, but this was something else. I considered myself unbelievably fortunate to have had the academic guidance I had received in my life. I was aware that I would not be here today at all in the first place if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the advice of my academic advisors and mentors. If I was lucky, what were students who were years ahead of me? Super lucky?\nWHAT GIVES? I have been thinking a lot recently about the extent to which serendipity and luck has has such a profound impact on my academic pursuits. I love where I have ended up. I am so incredibly happy in graduate school, but I was completely unaware of this option until a somewhat unreasonably late time. I am interested in exploring the role that luck played into my present circumstances. I want to understand what it was that made the ultimate difference for me. I need to understand, so that I may more effectively communicate these opportunities to those early in their academic careers.\n Students need to know about what is possible for them. NEARLY EVERY TIME I BRING UP TO PEOPLE THAT I GET PAID TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL, I AM MET WITH DISBELIEF.\n Why is it that so many are unaware that these* opportunities exist?\n WHERE IS THE FAILURE IN COMMUNICATION?\n *(let alone many many many others)\nAre we really getting our best and brightest into graduate school? Or would something like shyness inhibit someone from finding out, simply because they never went to office hours and had someone tell them?\nI will begin to explore these questions by retracing my own path to graduate school and looking for instances where earlier intervention may have made a substantive difference in my preparation. (I had very weak application in hindsight, so it is amazing any school took me at all, but more on that later\u0026hellip;).\n","date":1517468400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517468400,"objectID":"74b3ab4770782c37116ac5667a678fe6","permalink":"https://www.mathematicalmichael.com/post/advising1/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/advising1/","section":"post","summary":"How was it that these students were three, four, even seven years ahead of where I was in regards to their connections?","tags":["advising"],"title":"The Importance of Good Advising: Part 1","type":"post"},{"authors":["Michael Pilosov"],"categories":["rnr"],"content":"250 steps in 4 direction(s) chosen from 23 possible step size(s).\n$$ s = .06261041, \\;

The payoff for advances in biomedicine is obstructed by high failure rates that detract potential investors from investing in individual products. In their paper \"Commercializing Biomedical Research Through Securitization Techniques,\" Fernandez, Stein, \u0026 Lo propose a \"financial structure in which a large number of biomedical programs at various stages of development are funded by a single entity to substantially reduce the portfolio's risk...by employing financial engineering techniques such as securitization\" to raise greater amounts of capital for longer-term investment strategies. The authors have made available the source code and data sets with which they ran their simulations in order to invite academic scrutiny. We aim to understand the mechanics of the research and perform various scenarios-namely sensitivity analysis-with the simulation and visualize the stochastic processes involved.

Rather than manually augmenting successive frames to create the illusion of motion, the method presented here requires only the input of a few parameters for each transformation. We developed a mathematical framework wherein we defined animations as sequences of still images, and “transformations” as composable functions on such sequences.\n\nTo implement this work, we have built a MATLAB library of composable functions that streamline the process of turning still images into novel animations. Examples include manipulation of contrast, intensity, and colors of pixels, as well as warps of contours, positions, and size of select regions.

However,  to the best of my knowledge, no one has created animated GIFs solely from  a single still image.  I believe  this  is  because  current  technology  requires  tedious  manual  alteration  of  successive frames  to  create  such  animations.  I  investigated  whether  it  is  possible  to  automate  this  manual process  with  digital  image  transformations  by  working  at  the  interdisciplinary  intersection  of mathematics,  computer  science,  and  art.I  developed  a  mathematical  framework  wherein  I defined  “animations”  as  sequences  of  still  images,  and  “transformations”  as  composable functions  that  work  on  such  sequences.  To  implement  these  concepts,  I  built  a  library  of MATLAB functions that simplify and streamline the entire creative process by requiring only the input  of  a  few  parameters.

Basic strategy is simple to understand but the reasoning behind the probabilistic advantage is full of nuance and complications. We will provide a conceptual understanding of the mathematics underlying the advantage of counting cards in Blackjack. Multiple strategies will be discussed with attention to their relative benefits and efficacy of shifting the probability of winning towards the player and away from the casino. We will explain analytical approaches such as the Monte Carlo Method, a simulation method dependent on randomness; and the Kelly Criterion, a popular formula for scaling bet sizes.\n","tags":[],"title":"So You Want to Count Cards?","type":"talk"}]
