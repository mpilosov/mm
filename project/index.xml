      <description>A polygon is made with the number of sides corresponding to the year.
The number of distinct distances between the vertices of this shape and the origin are determined by the day.
The month influences the open-ness of the shape. In some instances, it appears to function like an aperature.
Hang Tight. This project will be live very soon.
Taking requests for special dates to host on this page as examples.</description>

      <description>This project is a work in progress. Mostly I am in need of help sorting through lyrics and removing contributions from collaborators, which Mr. West has many of.</description>

      <description>Please watch this space in the coming weeks.
I am reviving an old project that I have presented at a few conferences as an undergraduate. This work kickstarted (well, more like it really developed) my deep love for coding.
I am now transcribing work into Python to get away from the limitations of Matlab&amp;rsquo;s licensing structure.
It is a lengthy process. Please be patient.</description>

      <description>This once existed as a twitter bot. It will exist again shortly in another manifestation on this website soon.
Please contact me if you would like to participate and have your own piece of art live on this website, updating every day.</description>

      <description>More description to come soon.
I am reviving an old project that I have presented at a few conferences as an undergraduate. I won a cash prize for a talk I gave demonstrating an early version of this which involved my first graphical user interface.
I am now transcribing work into Python to get away from the limitations of Matlab&amp;rsquo;s licensing structure.
It is a lengthy process. Please be patient.</description>

      <description>Thousands of lines of Trump stump speeches mixed with the entirety of Lewis Carol&amp;rsquo;s Alice in Wonderland. More weight is given to Trump&amp;rsquo;s speeches. If you have more you would like me to include, please feel free to contact me.
Soon I will post a more complete story here and link to examples.</description>

      <description>This was a really fun project I undertook for a Math Club game night in 2016 with my friend Elliott Regan.
