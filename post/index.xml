      <title>Matplotlib Scatter Plots</title>

      <description>I ran into a problem while upgrading code from Python 2 to Python 3 that required me to downgrade matplotlib to version 2.2.3 in order to get the functionality in place (all tests were passing except for plotting). Once that dust settled, I attempted to individually upgrade to matplotlib==3.0.2 and ran into trouble with how scatter parses color sequences.
I had a lot of trouble finding a good solution online, but after sifting through a lot of forums and GitHub issues1, and trying many permutations of different syntaxes, I finally came around to a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; solution that passed the tests as they were written.</description>
