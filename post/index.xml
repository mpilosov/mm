      <title>Matplotlib Scatter Plots</title>

      <description>I ran into a problem while upgrading code from Python 2 to Python 3 that required me to downgrade matplotlib to version 2.2.3 in order to get the functionality in place (all tests were passing except for plotting). Once that dust settled, I attempted to individually upgrade to matplotlib==3.0.2 and ran into trouble with how scatter parses color sequences.
I had a lot of trouble finding a good solution online, but after sifting through a lot of forums and GitHub issues1, and trying many permutations of different syntaxes, I finally came around to a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; solution that passed the tests as they were written.</description>

      <description>I ran a series of tests and google searches to convert a repository to Python 3 from Python 2.
2to3 was a good starting point but the imports needed a lot of restructuring.
Then the other problems were all related to division operations. The default type is now Float, so 1/2 returns 0.5, whereas in Python 2 it returns 0 since the numerator is interpreted as an integer.
Drank coffee WAY too late in the evening and converted @DrPaulynomial&amp;#39;s #ActiveSubspaces repo to #Python3.</description>

      <description>I documented some of my prior advertising campaigns for SIAM and Math Club when I was in an executive board position at those organizations.
Check it out! The Math || Art (&amp;ldquo;Math or Art&amp;rdquo;) event in 2017 was by far the largest and most well-funded.
Several activity locations encouraged visitors to engage with mathematics in unusual ways through artistic mediums.

      <title>The Mathematics of Hallucination</title>

      <description>I found this article incredibly fascinating. I just had to post it here for posterity.
From Quanta Magazine:
 There is still much more to understand about hallucinations. Jean-Paul Sartre experimented with mescaline in Paris in 1935 and found it distorted his visual perception for weeks. Houses appeared to have “leering faces, all eyes and jaws,” clock faces looked like owls, and he saw crabs following him around all the time.</description>

      <description>Article: Learn Math for Machine Learning This article was one I found insightful and I agreed with most of its advice. Give it a read.
 To frame the math prerequisites, I first propose different mindsets and strategies for approaching your math education outside of traditional classroom settings.
 The links at the bottom of the article (partially reproduced below), led me to some thought-provoking reading:

      <title>Bridging the Skills Gap</title>

      <description>I live and breathe applied mathematics. Challenge problems are what I thrive on.
As such, programming comprises the vast majority of the &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; that I do. Theories are nothing without evidence, and my laboratory is the computer. I am a computational scientist, being trained as a mathematician.
Programming has enabled me to do so much more than the research I perform as part of my dissertation work. One can argue that my most marketable skill after graduation will be my software development experience.</description>

      <title>What The Function?</title>

      <description>To supplement my graduate student income, I have been tutoring in my department for several years. Many know how to manipulate them, but have never actually considered&amp;hellip; What is a function?  Metaphor allows us to explain that which is novel with that which is familiar.
 Imagine you have a blender. If you put in ingredients for a smoothie, you better get a smoothie out. If pancake batter magically appeared instead, you&amp;rsquo;d either be elated (because, pancakes), or really really upset.</description>

      <description>The Individual and the Group There has always been something about group-work in school that I resisted during childhood. I resented the forced pace of it all.
I now have the vantage point of a teacher, and understand the difficulty of running a classroom that caters to a wide range of student capabilities and backgrounds. Group-work is a way that I now attempt to stimulate collaboration and force those who &amp;ldquo;get it&amp;rdquo; to examine their understanding by explaining it.</description>

      <title>When Deadlines Aren&#39;t Really Deadlines</title>

      <description>I have always been the kind of person who takes deadlines seriously. I like to set deadlines for myself well ahead of the real ones just in case I want to make last minute revisions.
Despite years of applying for/to all sorts of academia-related things, I still often end up working on final tweaks at the last minute. Who knows if these are beneficial or not?
In one sense, I&amp;rsquo;m a big believer in deadlines.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Good Advising: Part 3</title>

      <description>You have to find someone you want to learn from.
That is what can make the difference between five years in graduate school and seven years. It can mean the difference between being lost and being directed in a productive manner.
Maybe I got lucky, but my present advisor has rarely let me go in a research direction that didn&amp;rsquo;t bear fruit of some kind or another. He knew when to shield me from complexity and when to implore me to pursue deeper understanding.</description>

      <description>Getting to Grad School As an undergraduate, I first experienced the extent to which mathematics could be broadly applied to &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; problems, and recognized the potential to make substantive change. I set my sights on a job in industry, with vague hopes and aspirations as to what such a thing might look like. I had been applying to summer programs that would potentially expose me to application areas every.</description>

      <description>Opportunistic Disparity and Serendipity This past summer I worked at a national laboratory that sees several thousand students come through its doors each year to develop their skills and networks. Orientation blew my mind. When my group was surveyed regarding where we were academically, I realized that graduate students made up something like a tenth of the room.
 Wait&amp;hellip; how did these kids get jobs here so early on?</description>
