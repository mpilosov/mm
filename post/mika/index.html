      <p>Happy Pi Day!</p>

<p>In celebration of this wonderful number, today I thought I&rsquo;d highlight a scientist who is out there in the wild doing math and weaving it into the content we consume. Meet Mika McKinnon:

<p>I came across her Twitter yesterday while I was sheltering-in-place during the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/03/13/colorado-weather-bomb-cyclone-blizzard/" target="_blank">&ldquo;bomb cyclone&rdquo;</a> hitting Denver, and this tweet jumped out at me immediately (I ❤️2️⃣👀 <em>math</em> on social media):</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
 </center></p>

<p>Naturally, I jumped into the conversation (thanks, Twitter!) and let my curiosity get the best of me:</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
 </center></p>

<p>We arranged a time to speak this morning and I was delighted to hear about her journey through <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0052933" target="_blank">geophysics</a> to consulting on the scientific integrity in modern storytelling.</p>

<p><small> I have selected some highlights from the interview to address how she got involved with this facet of science communication, but I am saving some of her stories for future blog posts (complete with pictures and sources to more scientific information!). </small></p>

<p><em>You&rsquo;ve got an impressive history on some big shows. How did you get involved in the film and television industry?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was in grad school doing disaster work. I actually started with volcanos on Mars and then ended up doing landslides on Earth! I was in Vancouver, which is nicknamed Hollywood North because we have so much SciFi filmed there &hellip; all these alien planets look like the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>One day we got a call for the physics department saying &ldquo;we need a string theorist!&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t a string theorist but my buddy Steve was&hellip; he literally put his research notes up on the sets of Stargate; he published string theory in Stargate three years before his dissertation.
It was really fun, and I quickly realized that they didn&rsquo;t actually need a &ldquo;string theorist;&rdquo; that was just the fanciest scientist they could think of.</p>

<p>When Steve left &hellip; and they came back looking for him, I went &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need a string theorist! You need me.&rdquo;
So I showed up on set, &hellip; I have no idea what my original instructions were, but apparently I did well enough that I then got invited to come back the next day, and the next day, and the next.</p>

<p>Vancouver is not just a city where a lot of SciFi films are made, it&rsquo;s a city where a lot of <em>unionized</em> SciFi films are made. People leave &hellip; and they remember who they worked with &hellip; then work on other amazing shows. I end up working on all these other shows because someone has my cell phone number from ten years ago and I&rsquo;ll get a call saying &ldquo;Hey, can you show up on set, like, tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Wow, you nailed the summary in the tweet. Right place and time plus maintaining a network! What was it like on set once you got there?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the more unusual parts about this was because they want real math and they want real science, and there&rsquo;s a script that gives you an idea of what the subject matter is. Mostly they&rsquo;d give me instructions like &ldquo;we need six feet of equations,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;d respond with &ldquo;six feet of equations on what?&rdquo; And they go &ldquo;just six feet!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I ended up doing a lot of things like, say, <strong>feed the energy of a solar flare into a black hole,</strong> which although mathematically valid, is just not something you&rsquo;d ever do in real life. I got the opportunity to do generally novel mathematics.</p>

<p>A lot of movies and TV shows will hire a specialist to do science at them and leave, but on Stargate I built up a relationship, one of trust. At the beginning, I was working for the property department (things actors would interact with), and I&rsquo;d get lent out to the &ldquo;set dec&rdquo; (set decoration department), and maybe VFX (&ldquo;video effects&rdquo;) would need me for something.</p>

<p>Over time, as I would reliably worked for them and was friendly, always answering questions between takes &hellip; I came to understand that this is not a science lesson, it is <em>a story with science in it, so story always comes first</em>. We eventually came to the point where the writing department would come to me with something like &ldquo;our starship is running out of oxygen, we need to go to an alien planet. How do they find the rocks they need to fix this?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>What was your favorite prompt?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[The writers came to me with], &ldquo;we need an astrophysical big baddie that kills every body every twenty-two minutes,&rdquo; which was by far my favorite thing I ever got to do at Stargate. Their original idea was a really <strong>slowly rotating pulsar.</strong></p>

<p>Now, a pulsar rotates on the order of milliseconds. A slow pulsar <em>still</em> rotates in milliseconds, so if you had one that rotated so its beam would cross every twenty-two <em>minutes</em>, <strong>the electromagnetic field would be about as deadly as holding refrigerator magnets and do cartwheels.</strong> Sure, it would generate an electromagnetic field, but it&rsquo;s not one anyone would even notice, much less kill somebody.</p>

<p>So my idea was to have a &ldquo;starving pulsar,&rdquo; one right on the brink of being able to pulse and not pulse, and put it in a binary star system, where one feeder star would zip by really close to a bigger star, and sap off some of that plasma and dust&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>At the time we did this episode, we never saw a system like this in real life</strong>, but we did see that pulsars <em>could be in binary system</em>, and we knew there were such thing as an inactive pulsar, so we went &ldquo;eh, this is plausible. why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three years later, scientists found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K971tt40iJw" target="_blank">such a system</a><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:These-rotated-at"><a href="#fn:These-rotated-at">1</a></sup> in real life! So I was super proud that <strong>we hypothesized this in Stargate as a major plot point three years before it was discovered.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I love the way you&rsquo;re just like&hellip; sneaking things into pop-culture this way. It&rsquo;s so wonderfully subversive.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah, I have so many references to my friends&rsquo; thesis work in various episodes of Stargate&hellip; it&rsquo;s pretty much that all my physics classmates have some sort of reference to their work somewhere on the blackboards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>That is incredible! How many people are there in similar roles?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very very few, as far as I know. There have been Science Consultants for a long time, going back to Star Trek, before I was even born.
But most people who do science consulting either do one show or movie and then never again, or they do a little bit of it and then transition into script writing.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, I am the longest running one &hellip; it&rsquo;s been over a decade at this point &hellip; and I&rsquo;m still doing science consulting as opposed to script writing. There are a handful of other people working on high-profile shows, but there are very few women, and they usually just do one-off engagements. It&rsquo;s not for a lack of want, it just seems that they haven&rsquo;t been able to.</p>

<p>A lot of people in science are deep fans of sci-fi, and it&rsquo;s such a common idea that &ldquo;if only they talked to me first, they could have fixed this idea.&rdquo; But it turns out it is much easier to destroy than create&hellip; It&rsquo;s kind of a game of &ldquo;yes-and&rdquo; improvisation&hellip; <strong>they&rsquo;re going to do the story they&rsquo;re going to do, and your job is to make it <em>plausible</em>.</strong> You will run into situations that may make you cringe a bit&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>But it&rsquo;s okay to sacrifice some scientific integrity for the sake of story.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, and that&rsquo;s exactly where you have to be. You have to understand that story comes first. It&rsquo;s all about the story and that we have some scientific plausibility there is great, but it is not the primary function of the show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>And what would you suggest to those interested in Science Communication as far as conferences, organizations, etc?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those looking to get involved, the National Academies of Sciences &ldquo;Entertainment Exchange&rdquo; is a great place to start. It&rsquo;s primarily one-off conversations, but it can lead to paid work. I consider it a great way to <em>learn the process</em>.</p>

<p>Figure out how to teach <em>quickly</em>, get to the high-end stuff first so [the writers] can pick between options, and then start running down what the various consequences would be, what could be incorporated as story-telling elements. How does it also play out in the details and how are they part of the world-building?</p>

<p>Those are the sorts of mindsets to put yourself in. As far as getting into the industry, look out for media fellowships and internships from organizations like the <a href="https://sites.agu.org" target="_blank">AGU</a>, <a href="https://www.aaas.org/" target="_blank">AAAS</a>, <a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org/" target="_blank">The National Academies</a>, <a href="https://www.aip.org/" target="_blank">AIP</a>, and various other subject-specific groups. Many even offer discounted legal services for members that freelance science communicators should definitely try to take advantage of!</p>

<p><a href="https://scicommcamp.com/" target="_blank">SciComm Camp</a> is an excellent event, and the <a href="https://www.nasw.org/" target="_blank">National Association of Science Writers</a> does a lot in this space. You can also look for local groups, and even volunteer to work with Creative Writing workshops to hone these kinds of skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>So there it is, put yourself in situations that facilitate networking, and maintain relationships you form in the industry. I&rsquo;ll leave you with one of my favorite quotes from our conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>My job is to be curious and excited in public, and it&rsquo;s all just different facets of that job.</strong></p>
