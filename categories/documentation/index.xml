      <description>I ran a series of tests and google searches to convert a repository to Python 3 from Python 2.
2to3 was a good starting point but the imports needed a lot of restructuring.
Then the other problems were all related to division operations. The default type is now Float, so 1/2 returns 0.5, whereas in Python 2 it returns 0 since the numerator is interpreted as an integer.
Drank coffee WAY too late in the evening and converted @DrPaulynomial&amp;#39;s #ActiveSubspaces repo to #Python3.</description>

      <description>Description Here is the proposal I submitted, with extraneous details (budgets) stripped away for clarity
 This event will be an excellent opportunity to expose the broader CU Denver community to the beauty and prevalence of mathematics. This is related to the integral mission of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) as well as the CU Denver Math Club. We want to demonstrate to people that our field doesn’t have to feel like an esoteric and unfamiliar place, especially owing to its widespread prevalence in people’s lives, which goes unnoticed.</description>
