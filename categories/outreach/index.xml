      <description>It is really difficult for content creators to figure out how to balance creative storytelling and scientific communication. Here are some channels on youtube that I believe are doing a great job at it. Do feel free to contact me and suggest more!
Verge Science | The Verge A division of Vox, they do very compelling work and have engaging hosts.
