      <description>A polygon is made with the number of sides corresponding to the year.
The number of distinct distances between the vertices of this shape and the origin are determined by the day.
The month influences the open-ness of the shape. In some instances, it appears to function like an aperature.

Taking requests for special dates to host on this page as examples.</description>
