      <description>Please watch this space in the coming weeks.
I am reviving an old project that I have presented at a few conferences as an undergraduate. This work kickstarted (well, more like it really developed) my deep love for coding.
I am now transcribing work into Python to get away from the limitations of Matlab&amp;rsquo;s licensing structure.
It is a lengthy process. Please be patient.</description>
