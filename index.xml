      <description>MS, Applied Mathematics,Mathematics of Sciences and Engineering.
PhD Candidate

I help extract useful information from scientific experiments. Click here to learn more. After graduation, I will work on diverse problems in a variety of fields that serve a humanitarian purpose.
If you are curious about whether you have a problem that can benefit from some uncertainty quantification or experimental design, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how.</description>

      <description>I work in the field of Uncertainty Quantification, specifically on inverse problems (usually with models involving physics).
I am concerned about how experimental data impacts predictions.
Sometimes that means getting the most out of what limited data is available.
Other times it involves designing the experiment so that each measurement is as informative as possible.
Not all data are equally useful. I help decide what is worth measuring.
The applications of my academic research are numerous.</description>
